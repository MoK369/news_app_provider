# News App

NewsApp is a dynamic and user-friendly mobile application designed to keep users informed with news from around the world. The app fetches news articles from a reliable website API and categorizes them into various topics for easy navigation and personalized reading experiences.

# Features
1. Multiple Categories:
 News articles are organized into different categories such as Sports, Technology, Entertainment, Health, and Business. Users can easily switch between categories to find news that interests them.

2. Search Functionality:
Users can search for specific news articles or topics using the built-in search feature, allowing them to quickly find relevant information.

3. User-friendly Interface:

# Things We Learned
- How to call an API and we use http package to do that.
- taking the response of the API and receiving it into a Data Model Class.
- Paginating News articles allowing us not to load all articles at once if they were a lot.
